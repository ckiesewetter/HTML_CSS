      <p>First off my name is Charlie; and im obsessed with bacon. Turkey bacon is blashpamy, and can no way be accpetable in any form or fashion. The simple thought of eating bacon makes my lip quiver.  We have a militant type ideology about bacon in that it can be used in and shape form or fashion. Bacon can be wrapped around a scallop like text around a picture on a web page.

    <p>My name is not Charlie; my name is Erik. But even though I do not have the same name as my partner, I share his strong affection for bacon. Bacon is one of those foods that is just incomparable. Once you eat the bacon, you will see the <em>TRUTH</em>. But even better than bacon is KALE. Kale is green and healthy and tastes terrible but hey when you mix it with bacon it's a DREAM.
